UX
 
Mood Food is a site that shares recipes from 4 different cuisines. Its purpose is to encourage people to make homemade meals with easy-to-follow beginner recipes. The different cuisines help cater for each taste and keep people motivated. The site targets people who enjoy different foods but do not know how to make these dishes themselves. It’s a healthy way of enjoying that curry without breaking the bank.
